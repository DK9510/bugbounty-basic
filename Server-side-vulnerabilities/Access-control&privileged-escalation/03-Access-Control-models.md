## what are Access Control Security Models
- it is definition of a set of access control rules that is independent of technology or implementation platforms.
- it can be implemented with in Operating System, Networks, database management systems, back office, application, web server software etc.

various access control models
- Programmatic access control
- Discretionary access control(DAC)
- Mandatory access control(MAC)
- Role-based access control(RBAC)

## Programmatic Access Control
- a matrix of user privileges is stored in a database and access controls are applied programmatically with the referance to the matrix.
- this can include Roles or Groups or individual users

## Discretionary access Control (DAC)
- in this the access to resources or functions is constrained based upon users or named groups of users.
- owner has ability to grant and remove access permission of other users.
- this model is very complex to design and manage.

## Mandatory access control(MAC)
- it is centrally controlled system of access control in which access to some object by a subject is constrained.
- unlike DAC the users and owner of the resources have no capabilities to modify the access rights for anyone to their resources.

## Role-based access Control(RBAC)
- in this roles are defined to which access privilege are assigned.
- users then assigned to single or multiple roles.
- it provides enhanced management then other models.
- It is more effective when there are sufficient roles to properly invoke access control but not so many, because it make it excessively complex and very hard to manage.
