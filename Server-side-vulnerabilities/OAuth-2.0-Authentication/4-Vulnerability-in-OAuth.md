## How do OAuth vulnerability arises
* OAuth authentication vulnerabilities arise partly because the OAuth specification is relatively vague and flexible by design.
* there's plenty of opportunity for bad practice to creep in.
* lack of built-in security features.
* Depending on the grant type, highly sensitive data is also sent via the browser, which presents various opportunities for an attacker to intercept it.

### Identifying OAuth Authentication 
* If you see an option to log in using your account from a different website, this is a strong indication that OAuth is being used.
* another is proxying your traffic through burp and check corresponding HTTP messages when trying login.
* keep an eye out for the `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and `response_type` parameters
* Example:
```js
GET /authorization?client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https://client-app.com/callback&response_type=token&scope=openid%20profile&state=ae13d489bd00e3c24 HTTP/1.1  
Host: oauth-authorization-server.com
```

### Recon
* external OAuth service is used, you should be able to identify the specific provider from the `hostname` to which the authorization request is sent. As these services provide a `public API`, there is often detailed documentation available that should tell you all kinds of useful information, such as the `exact names of the endpoints` and which configuration options are being used.
* once we know hostname of the Authorization server try to send GET Request to 
```js
GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server(the authorization server is used by application)

GET /.well-known/openi-configuration 
```
These will return JSON Configuration file containing Key information such as `details of additional features that may supported` this gives up wider attack surface and supported feature that may not be mentioned in the documentation
