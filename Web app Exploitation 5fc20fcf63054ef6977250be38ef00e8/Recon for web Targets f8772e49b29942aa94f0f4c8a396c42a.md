# Recon for web Targets

# detect attack surface & assets

- find technology used by the application or assets so we test specific vulnerability, and leave other so, it will reduce wastage of time in finding vulnerability that may not possible due to technology stack used for building asset or application

# Methods

## 1. Manually walking through target

- manually go through application and every click and data entry proxying through burp in the background so it capture every request and response, which we can analyze after
- this will give rough idea about the attack surface & different end points

## 2. Google Dorking

- GHDB : [https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)
- use this to find jucy information/endpoint - files/login panels etc

## 3. whois & reverse whois lookup

- reverse whois, used to identifying company's domain based on company

## 4. IP Address

- company's ip ranges may hosted a different web service in different ports
- use `nslookup` for domain

## 5. Certificate parsing

- use censys, [crt.sh](http://crt.sh/), Cert Spotter

## 6. Subdomain Enumeration

- use sublist3r, amass, subfinder , gobuster to find subdomains

## 7. Service Enumeration

- use masscan, nmap, naabu for service enumeration on non-default ports `Active scanning`
- `Passive Scanning` use shodan, censys for identifying services running

## 8. Directory Brute-forcing

- used to find more hidden content of target
- Dirsearch, dirb, gobuster, ffuf etc

## 9. Spidering The Site

- crawling/ spidering used to discovering paths or endpoints, urls, etc

## 10. 3rd party hosting

- amazon s3, tool: lazys3, [https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/)
- bucket stream : [https://github.com/eth0izzle/bucket-stream](https://github.com/eth0izzle/bucket-stream) , find bucket from certificate parsing and automate work
- awscli

## 11. Github Recon

- find secrets, apikeys, code used in production, hidden endpoints,
- by searching for releavent company, organization, employes repo etc
- pay close look at commits and changes they may lead to jucy info
- [https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks](https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks) give how to use credentials
- tools: Gitrob, TruffleHog

# Other Sneaky OSINT Technique

## Look For Engineering Job Post ad

- eg.

```
Full Stack Engineer
Minimum Qualifications:
Proficiency in Python and C/C++
Linux experience
Experience with Flask, Django, and Node.js
Experience with Amazon Web Services, especially EC2, ECS, S3, and RDS

```

this will revel many technology & stacks company is using and we test according to that.

- see company's top employes blog, or stackoverflow, or profile which expertise them , give us what technology used by company
- see employes google calanders, they may contain credentials, meet info, slides etc
- social media page, leak information like credentials, notes in pictures
- check company's `slideshare` & `Pastebin.com` may contain text/notes/information `https://github.com/kevthehermit/PasteHunter/` pastbin tool for automate task
- use wayback archive, find old endpoints, directory listing tool: Waybackurs(tomnomnom)

# Tech Stack Fingerprinting

- identify software brands, version, got CVE, misconfiguration etc
- http-headers may leak server used, version os technology etc
- in HTML source code, ctrl+u search for `powered by, built with,running` get website built in stack/version etc
- use Wappalyzer for identifying/fingerpriting the web application: use [Builtwith.com](http://builtwith.com/)
- [StackShare.io](http://stackshare.io/) platform used by developere to share their stack
- Retire.js tool used to detect outdated js lib,and NOde packages
