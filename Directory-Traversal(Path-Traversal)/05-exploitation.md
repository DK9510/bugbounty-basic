 * Many applications that place user input into file paths implement some kind of defense against path traversal attacks, and these can often be circumvented.
 * if application blocks or strips directory traversal sequence there is many bypassing technique is available
 * we might directly access absolute path `file=/etc/passwd` with out using any traversal.
 * You might be able to use various non-standard encoding, such as `..%c0%af` or `..%252f`, to bypass the input filter.
* [filter-bypass-technique](https://code.google.com/archive/p/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/wikis/AdvancedObfuscationPathtraversal.wiki)
* might user `....//`or `....\\`if one `..../ or ....\ ` is blocked than after removing them we traverse it.
* If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must start with the expected base folder, such as `/var/www/images`, then it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences. For example:`filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`
* If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must end with an expected file extension, such as `.png`, then it might be possible to use a null byte to effectively terminate the file path before the required extension. For example:`filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png`
