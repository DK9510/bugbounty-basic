## How to test for info disclosure
- Fuzzing
- Using Burp Scanner
- Using Burp's engagement tools
- Engineering information responses

### Fuzzing
If you identify interesting parameters, you can try submitting unexpected data types and specially crafted fuzz strings to see what effect this has. Pay close attention; although responses sometimes explicitly disclose interesting information, they can also hint at the application's behavior more subtly.
- user `logger++` burp extension for logging all the request and response from burp tools

### Using Burp Scanner
`only for burp suite Professional` users only.

### Engineering informative responses
- Verbose error messages can sometimes disclose interesting information while you go about your normal testing workflow. However, by studying the way error messages change according to your input, you can take this one step further. In some cases, you will be able to manipulate the website in order to extract arbitrary data via an error message.

## common Source of information disclosure

### Files for web crawlers
- Many websites provide files at `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` to help crawlers navigate their site.
- these files often list specific directories that the crawlers should skip, for example, because they may contain sensitive information.

### Directory Listing
- Web servers can be configured to automatically list the contents of directories that do not have an index page present.
- This can aid an attacker by enabling them to quickly identify the resources at a given path, and proceed directly to analyzing and attacking those resources. It particularly increases the exposure of sensitive files within the directory that are not intended to be accessible to users, such as temporary files and crash dumps.

### Developer Comments
- During development, in-line HTML comments are sometimes added to the markup. These comments are typically stripped before changes are deployed to the production environment.

### Error Message
- One of the most common causes of information disclosure is verbose error messages. As a general rule, you should pay close attention to all error messages you encounter during auditing.
- we can supply any unwanted or `different datatype in the parameter`that is different from what it accept and this will give us an error.

### Debugging data
-  For debugging purposes, many websites generate custom error messages and logs that contain large amounts of information about the application's behavior. While this information is useful during development, it is also extremely useful to an attacker if it is leaked in the production environment.
##### it may contain
- values for key session variable that can be manipulated via user input
- Hostnames and credentials for the back-end components
- Files and directory names on the server
- keys used to encrypt data transmitted via the client
### User Account pages
- By their very nature, a user's profile or account page usually contains sensitive information, such as the user's email address, phone number, API key, and so on.
- For example, consider a website that determines which user's account page to load based on a `user` parameter.`GET /user/personal-info?user=victim-user`
- example `IDOR`

### Source code disclosure via backup files
- Obtaining source code access makes it much easier for an attacker to understand the application's behavior and construct high-severity attacks. Sensitive data is sometimes even hard-coded within the source code. Typical examples of this include API keys and credentials for accessing back-end components.
- obtaining source code may some times lead to `Insecure Deserialization`

### Information disclosure due to insecure configuration
- Websites are sometimes vulnerable as a result of improper configuration. This is especially common due to the widespread use of third-party technologies, whose vast array of configuration options are not necessarily well-understood by those implementing them.
- In other cases, developers might forget to disable various debugging options in the production environment. For example, the HTTP `TRACE` method is designed for diagnostic purposes. If enabled, the web server will respond to requests that use the `TRACE` method by echoing in the response the exact request that was received. This behavior is often harmless, but occasionally leads to information disclosure, such as the name of internal authentication headers that may be appended to requests by reverse proxies.
##### Authentication Bypass via Information Disclosure
- we know that admin panel only accessible to local user that means `localhost`
- and `TRACE` request to the page and it will gives us the supported or Hidden headers in web page we analyze it and take advantage of it to send request contain these headers with custom values and exploit the server.

### Version control history
- Virtually all websites are developed using some form of version control system, such as Git. By default, a Git project stores all of its version control data in a folder called `.git`.
- This may include logs containing committed changes and other interesting information.
- This might not give you access to the full source code, but comparing the diff will allow you to read small snippets of code. As with any source code, you might also find sensitive data hard-coded within some of the changed lines.
- `open that .git directory using git cola or any git version control software`
