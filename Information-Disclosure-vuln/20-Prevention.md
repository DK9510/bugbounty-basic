## how to prevent Information disclosure vulnerabilities
Preventing information disclosure completely is tricky due to the huge variety of ways in which it can occur. However, there are some general best practices that you can follow to minimize the risk of these kinds of vulnerability creeping into your own websites.

- Make sure that everyone involved in producing the website is fully aware of what information is considered sensitive.
- Audit any code for potential information disclosure as part of your QA or build processes.
- Use generic error messages as much as possible. Don't provide attackers with clues about application behavior unnecessarily.
- Double-check that any debugging or diagnostic features are disabled in the production environment.
- Make sure you fully understand the configuration settings, and security implications, of any third-party technology that you implement. Take the time to investigate and disable any features and settings that you don't actually need.
